## What is Lower?
Lower Framework is a lightweight, modular web framework written in C that speeds up development with its flexibility and high performance. It allows you to customize and extend modules easily to fit your needs. With [LowPM](https://trycatch.network), integrating external libraries and managing modules becomes simple and efficient, making your projects faster and more maintainable.

## Getting Started & Integration
Include basic modules for run
```shell
git clone https://github.com/trycatchh/lower.git
```
Add the library to your code file
```c
#include "lower/run.h" // Runtime module
```
To add libraries, please refer to the [documentation of the LowPM](https://trycatch.network/) repository.

## For Example
##### Create a handler
```c
void hello_handler(http_request_t *req, http_response_t *res) {
    lw_set_header(res, "Content-Type: text/plain");
    lw_set_body(res, "Hello from Lower Web Framework!");
}
void json_handler(http_request_t *req, http_response_t *res) {
    lw_set_header(res, "Content-Type: application/json");
    lw_set_body(res, "{\"message\": \"Hello JSON!\", \"framework\": \"Lower Web Framework\"}");
}
void about_handler(http_request_t *req, http_response_t *res) {
    lw_set_header(res, "Content-Type: text/html");
    lw_set_body(res, "<h1>About Lower Web Framework</h1><p>A simple C web framework</p>");
}
```
##### Register the handler and run the server
```c
int main() {
    lw_route(GET, "/", hello_handler);
    lw_route(GET, "/hello", hello_handler);
    lw_route(GET, "/json", json_handler);
    lw_route(GET, "/about", about_handler);
    
    return lw_run(8080);
}
```
