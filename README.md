## What is Lower?
Lower Framework is a lightweight, modular web framework written in C that speeds up development with its flexibility and high performance. It allows you to customize and extend modules easily to fit your needs. With [LowPM](https://trycatch.network), integrating external libraries and managing modules becomes simple and efficient, making your projects faster and more maintainable.

## Getting Started
### Use LW Structure
[Copy the project](https://github.com/trycatchh/lower.git) directly and stand it up. All the structures that should be in the project will come, just commit your project on it.

### Include Your Project
Include basic modules for run
```shell
git clone https://github.com/trycatchh/lower.git
```
Add the library to your code file
```c
#include "lower/run.h" // Runtime module
```
To add libraries, please refer to the [documentation of the LowPM](https://trycatch.network/) repository.

## Integration
##### Create a handler
```c
void index_handler(http_request_t *req, http_response_t *res) {
    (void)req;
    render_html(res, "index.html");
}
```
##### Register the handler and run the server
```c
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    parameter_controller(argc, argv);
    use_static_files(); // if u want: (public: html/, css/, js/...)
    lw_route(GET, "/", index_handler);
    
    return lw_run(parameter_controller(argc, argv));
}
```
[Static Files Supports](https://github.com/trycatchh/lower/blob/fc2307e7e325985ee733444f018aa8c6f6b8fa34/html_handler.c#L159)

## How to Use?
If you have included LowerWF in your project later, compile it with your own build technique. But if you are using the project template, follow this path:
```shell
make clean && make # build project
```
You can then run the project. You can send commands to the binary file of the software as follows:
```shell
sudo ./build/lwserver -p 8282 -d
```
> With the -h argument, you can use the appropriate command from the command documentation and find out what the commands are.
